# Godot tutorial

This is a repository which holds assets, scripts and other files for my first attempt at using the Godot engine. I am following along a [Brackeys tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0) and putting my own spin on it, testing some stuff and defining my flow for working with Godot.
